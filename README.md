# How to Install?
Installing is simple, firstly you have to get the file from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ao2eiZha5MtfYT5XcsjLLVCYXtRjbcuV/view?usp=sharing), since I can't upload it to GitHub. Then, you just set it up.

## What is Minimal11?
Minimal11 is a light version of Windows 11 with slight modifications in order to remove excessive components that come with the default Windows 11 install. This version does not remove the Windows 11 requirements though. This custom ISO image also disabled all the telemetry and data collection added in Windows 11.

## What components are removed?
Though I may not be able to list all the components that are removed, I may be able to list a few:

- Xbox Components
- Store Experience Host
- Windows Apps (Windows Maps, Calendar, Clock, etc.)
**And More**

## Does this custom ISO come with custom drivers?
No, it does not come with custom drivers for users.

## Does it come with custom programs?
Yes, it comes with only VLC which is a replacement for Windows' default video and music players.

## Will I have to do further debloating in order to achieve a more-minimum experience?
Yes, this step is required if you want all the minimal experience. I was not able to implement this, since the program which I was making it on had limitations.

_This program was created using **NTLite**._
